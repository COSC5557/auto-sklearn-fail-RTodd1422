# Auto-sklearn Fail

The code in `fail.py` runs
[auto-sklearn](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/) on a dataset for 5
minutes. The model it finds after that time is *worse* than just using a random
forest with default hyperparameters.

Find out what's going on, why auto-sklearn's performance is so bad, and how to
fix it.


# Explanation

The core of the problem is the encoding done by OneHotEncoder. The OneHotEncoder is meant for use on categorical data. The data it is being applied to is very much not categorical. So it makes sense that the performance is very poor.
